Tiny Brother
============
Tiny brother is a tool to monitor your internet with two parts:

1. The watchdog. This is what collects the data. Defaults are speedtesting at 6
   AM every morning, but this can be changed.
2. The interactive dashboard. This is how you see the results and determine if
   you're getting what was promised.
